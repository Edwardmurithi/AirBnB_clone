Airbnb Clone


Introduction
Welcome to the Airbnb Clone project! This project is part of the SE Foundations curriculum and will span until the end of the first year. The goal is to deploy a simple copy of the Airbnb website on your server. While not all features of the actual Airbnb will be implemented, this project covers fundamental concepts of higher-level programming.

Project Overview
The project will be built step-by-step and will include the following components:

Command Interpreter: A tool to manipulate data without a visual interface, perfect for development and debugging.
Website: A front-end to display the final product, both static and dynamic.
Data Storage: Data will be stored either in files or a database.
API: A RESTful API to provide a communication interface between the front-end and the data (to retrieve, create, delete, and update data).
Final Product
Concepts to Learn
Unittest: Essential for working collaboratively on test cases.
Python Packages: Understanding and utilizing Python packages.
Serialization/Deserialization: Converting objects to a format that can be easily stored and retrieved.
***args, kwargs: Handling variable numbers of arguments in functions.
Datetime: Managing date and time in Python.
Steps
The application will be built in the following steps, each linked to specific concepts:

1. The Console
Create the data model.
Manage objects via a console/command interpreter.
Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file).
2. Web Static
Learn HTML/CSS.
Create the HTML of the application.
Create templates for each object.
3. MySQL Storage
Replace file storage with database storage.
Map models to a database table using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
4. Web Framework - Templating
Create the first web server in Python.
Make static HTML files dynamic using objects stored in a file or database.
5. RESTful API
Expose all objects via a JSON web interface.
Manipulate objects through a RESTful API.
6. Web Dynamic
Learn JQuery.
Load objects from the client side using the RESTful API.
Files and Directories
models: Contains all classes used for the project. Each class represents an object/instance in an OOP project.
tests: Contains all unit tests.
console.py: Entry point of the command interpreter.
models/base_model.py: Base class for all models, containing common attributes and methods.
models/engine: Contains storage classes. Initially, it will include file_storage.py.
Storage
Persistency is crucial for a web application, ensuring that data is not lost between program executions. This project will handle two types of storage: file and database. Initially, the focus will be on file storage.

Why Separate "Storage Management" from "Model"?
This separation ensures that models are modular and independent, allowing easy storage system replacement without extensive codebase modifications.

Storing Instances
Instances will be converted to a JSON representation for storage, a standard format that is both human-readable and compatible with other programs. The process involves converting instances to serializable data structures and then to strings in JSON format for writing to a file. Deserialization involves the reverse process.

Key Concepts
*args, **kwargs
Allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments. *args is a tuple of positional arguments, and **kwargs is a dictionary of keyword arguments.

Datetime
Python's datetime module is used for manipulating dates and times. Instances of datetime can be formatted as strings using strftime for readability.


Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of web application development, covering key concepts such as data modeling, web development, storage management, and API integration. By the end of this project, you will have a complete web application similar to Airbnb, ready to be deployed and used.
